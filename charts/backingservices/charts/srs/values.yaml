  # The following section specifies the mTLS configuration.
  # Set srs.srsStorage.mtls.enabled: true to enable the use of mTLS-based authentication to your Elasticsearch/OpenSearch service.
  # SRS to Elasticsearch/Opensearch mTLS is supported only with external Elasticsearch/OpenSearch. mTLS is not supported for internally-provisioned ES.
  # To enable mTLS between SRS and Elasticsearch/OpenSearch(External), enable the mTLS flag
  # and configure the truststore, the keystore, and their respective passwords of the external Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.
  # Note that the srs.srsRuntime.ssl.enabled flag above is used to enable tls/mTLS for SRS.
  # The srs.srsStorage.mtls.enabled flag below is used to specify that the Elasticsearch/Opensearch being used is enabled with mTLS

    # The below certificate details are used for establishing mTLS between SRS and Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.
    # You can use the same keystore and truststore can that you configured above for SRS (srs.srsRuntime.ssl.key-store and srs.srsRuntime.ssl.trust-store)
    # or you can use a new keystore and truststore.
    # Ensure that you add the required CA certificates to the truststore to establish a secure
    # connection between SRS and Elasticsearch/OpenSearch in case of mTLS.
    # Uncomment the keystore and truststore details below and configure the required certificate paths.
    # NOTE :
    # You can use the same keystore and truststore if:
    # a) the CA certificate used for generating keystore and truststore for Elasticsearch/OpenSearch are the same as the one used for SRS.
    # b) the CA certificates used for SRS and ES are different but both the CA Certificates were signed against the truststore of ES and truststore of SRS.
    # Although the best practice is to use the SRS keystore and truststore (where the truststore is signed against both CA certificates of SRS and ES)
    # to establish connectivity between SRS and ES,
    # you can use a different keystore and truststore for establishing connectivity between SRS and ES.
    # To specify a different keystore and truststore using a secret, uncomment the below 'srs.srsStorage.mtls.certsSecret' parameter
    # and provide the secret name containing your certificates and their respective passwords.
