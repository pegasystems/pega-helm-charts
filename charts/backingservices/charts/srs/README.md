# Search and Reporting Service Helm chart

The Pega `Search and Reporting Service` or `SRS` backing service can replace the embedded search feature of Pega Infinity Platform. To use it in your deployment, you provision and deploy it independently as an external service which provides search and reporting capabilities with a Pega Infinity environment.

## Configuring a backing service with your pega environment

You can provision this SRS into your `pega` environment namespace, with the SRS endpoint configured with the Pega Infinity environment. When you include the SRS into your pega namespace, the service endpoint is included within your Pega Infinity environment network to ensure isolation of your application data.

## Search and Reporting Service support

The Search and Reporting Service provides next generation search and reporting capabilities for Pega Infinity 8.6 and later.

This service replaces the legacy search module from the platform with an independently deployable and scalable service along with the built-in capabilities to support more than one Pega environments with its data isolation features in Pega Infinity 8.6 and later.
The service deployment provisions runtime service pods along with a dependency on a backing technology ElasticSearch service for storage and retrieval of data.

**Note:**

### If your deployment uses the internally-provisioned Elasticsearch: ###
To migrate to Elasticsearch version 7.17.9 or 8.10.3 from the Elasticsearch version 7.10.2 or 7.16.3, perform the following steps:
1. Update the SRS Docker image version to use v1.31.2. This version has backward compatibility with Elasticsearch versions 7.10.x and 7.16.x, so your SRS will continue to work even before you update your Elasticsearch service.
2. To update Elasticsearch version to 7.17.9 perform the following actions:
    * Update the Elasticsearch `dependencies.version` parameter in the [requirement.yaml](../../requirements.yaml) to 7.17.3.
    
      Note: This parameter references the Elasticsearch Helm chart version and not the Elasticsearch cluster version.  
    * Update the elasticsearch.imageTag in the Backing Services Helm chart to 7.17.9.
3. To update Elasticsearch version to 8.10.3, perform the following actions:
    * Update the Elasticsearch `dependencies.version` parameter in the [requirement.yaml](../../requirements.yaml) to 8.5.1.

      Note: This parameter references the Elasticsearch Helm chart version and not the Elasticsearch cluster version.
    * Update the elasticsearch.imageTag in the Backing Services Helm chart to 8.10.3.
4. Restart the SRS pods

### If your deployment connects to an externally-managed Elasticsearch service: ###
To migrate to Elasticsearch version 7.17.9 or 8.10.3 from the Elasticsearch version 7.10.2 or 7.16.3, perform the following steps:
1. Update the SRS Docker image version to use v1.31.2. This version has backward compatibility with Elasticsearch versions 7.10.x and 7.16.x, so your SRS will continue to work even before you update your Elasticsearch service.
2. To use Elasticsearch version 7.17.9, upgrade your external Elasticsearch cluster to 7.17.9 according to your organization’s best practices. For more information, see official Elasticsearch version 7.17 documentation.
3. To use Elasticsearch version 8.10.3, upgrade your external Elasticsearch cluster to 8.10.3 according to your organization’s best practices. For more information, see official Elasticsearch version 8.10 documentation.
4. Restart the SRS pods

### SRS runtime configuration

The values.yaml provides configuration options to define the deployment resources along with option to either provision ElasticSearch cluster automatically for data storage, or you can choose to configure an existing externally managed elasticsearch cluster to use as a datastore with the SRS runtime.

If an externally managed elasticsearch cluster is being used, make sure the service is accessible to the k8s cluster where SRS is deployed.

You may enable the component of [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/elasticsearch/values.yaml) in the backingservices by configuring the 'srs.srsStorage' section in values.yaml file to deploy ElasticSearch cluster automatically. For more configuration options available for each of the components, see their Helm Charts.

Note: Pega does **not** actively update the elasticsearch dependency in `requirements.yaml`. To leverage SRS, you must do one of the following:

* To use the internally-provided Elasticsearch service in the SRS cluster, use the default `srs.enabled.true` parameter and set the Elasticsearch version by updating the `elasticsearch.imageTag` parameter in the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) to match the `dependencies.version` parameter in the [requirements.yaml](../../requirements.yaml). This method streamlines the deployment process for development and testing environments, but it is not suitable for production environments, which require a fully external Elasticsearch cluster. Additionally, even though you deploy SRS and Elasticsearch together, Pega does not license the Elasticsearch cluster deployed using this method and does not maintain it as part of the Pega Platform support.
* To use an externally-provided Elasticsearch service with SRS, use the default `srs.enabled.true` parameter, update the `srs.srsStorage.provisionInternalESCluster` parameter in the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) to `false` and then provide connection details as documented below. This is the recommended method and is suitable for production environments.

### Deploying SRS with Pega-provided busybox images
To deploy Pega Platform with the SRS backing service, the SRS helm chart requires the use of the busybox image.  For clients who want to pull this image from a registry other than Docker Hub, they must tag and push their image to another registry, and then pull it by specifying `busybox.image` and `busybox.imagePullPolicy`.

The [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/elasticsearch/values.yaml) chart defines the values for Elasticsearch provisioning in the SRS cluster. For internally provisioned Elasticsearch the default version is set to `7.17.9`. Set the `elasticsearch.imageTag` parameter in values.yaml to `7.16.3` to use this supported version in the SRS cluster.                                                                |

### Enable TLS/HTTPS between SRS and Pega Infinity
There are multiple ways to enable TLS/HTTPS for service which deployed in k8s. It all depends on the k8s setup, environment setup and network policies/restrictions etc. You can work with IT departments to get this done. Some ways to enable TLS/HTTPS are 1. [Using ingress with TLS ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls). 2. [Using load balancer ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) etc. Some cloud provided k8s specific ways are 1) AWS: Using combination of [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/), [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/kubernetes-ingress-aws-alb-ingress-controller/), [Kubernetes Nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#aws). 2. Azure: Using combination of [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/), [Kubernetes Nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#azure), [Azure Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/). 3. GCP: Using combination of [Google-managed SSL certificates](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs), [GCP HTTP(S) Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/), [Kubernetes Nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#gce-gke) etc.

Example:

```yaml
srs:
  # Set srs.enabled=true to enable SRS
  enabled: true

  # specify unique name for the deployment based on org app and/or srs applicable environment name. eg: acme-demo-dev-srs

      # AuthEnabled may be set to true when there is an authentication mechanism in place between SRS and Pega Infinity.
      AuthEnabled: false
      # When `AuthEnabled` is `true`, enter the appropriate public key URL. When `AuthEnabled` is `false`(default), leave this parameter empty.
      OAuthPublicKeyURL: ""

  # This section specifies the elasticsearch cluster configuration.
  srsStorage:
    # Setting srsStorage.provisionInternalESCluster to true will provision an internal elasticsearch cluster using the configuration
    # specified in the `elasticsearch` section

### Steps to upgrade SRS (with Internal Elasticsearch) to Kubernetes Cluster Version >=1.25

To support SRS on Kubernetes version >=1.25 you need to use Elasticsearch server version 7.17.9. If you are using an earlier version (7.10.2 or 7.16.3) of Elasticsearch in your deployment, to upgrade to 7.17.9, you need to perform the following steps:
1. Get the latest backingservices Helm chart which supports `k8s version >=1.25`.
2. Update the SRS and Elasticsearch certificates by running the following Make command:
  ```bash
  make update-secrets NAMESPACE=<NAMESPACE_OF EXISTING_DEPLOYMENT> ELASTICSEARCH_VERSION=7.17.9
  ```
3.   To use Elasticsearch version 7.17.9, inspect the values.yaml file from the latest backingservices helm chart and confirm if the imageTag parameter in the values.yaml file is same as in the example below:
  ```yaml
  elasticsearch:
    imageTag: 7.17.9
  ```
4. Upgrade your deployment using the following Helm command:
  ```bash
  helm upgrade backingservices pega/backingservices --version <CHART_VERSION> --namespace <NAMESPACE_OF EXISTING_DEPLOYMENT> --values <YAML_FILE_WITH_ES_IMAGE_TAG_CHANGES>
  ```
5. Verify that the Elasticsearch pods status is Running.
6. Restart the old SRS pods and verify that the status of the new pods is Running.
7. Verify all pods are running and working as expected.
