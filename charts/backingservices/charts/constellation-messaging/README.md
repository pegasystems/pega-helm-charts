# Constellation Messaging Service

The optional Messaging service acts as a middle man between information publishers and information subscribers; accepting simple http publish of information to forward to 1000's of websocket subscribers. The publishers are typically the Infinity case engine or 3rd party integration services, and the subscribers are UI components in browsers running Constellation UI.

Once the service routing (with TLS) is set up, configure the Pega Infinity ConstellationMessageSvcHostPath DSS to your service URL (e.g.  yourhostname.com/c11n-messaging). Do not include a protocol for this setting.

Only a single Messaging Service deployment is necessary to support an entire organization.  Do not install the service in every namespace or for every application or project.

Complete information on the design of the service including architecture, scalability, reliability, operations and troubleshooting is available at [Constellation service deployment](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/platform/page/platform/deployment/constellation/constellation-overview.html).

### Liveness and readiness probes

Constellation messaging service uses liveness and readiness to determine application health in your deployments. For an overview of these probes, see [Configure Liveness and Readiness Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). Configure a probe for *liveness* to determine if a Pod has entered a broken state; configure it for *readiness* to determine if the application is available to be exposed. If not explicitly configured, default probes are used during the deployment. Set the following parameters as part of a `livenessProbe` or `readinessProbe` configuration.

Notes:
* `timeoutSeconds` cannot be greater than `periodSeconds` in some GCP environments. For details, see [this API library from Google](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/compute/v1/csharp/latest/classGoogle_1_1Apis_1_1Compute_1_1v1_1_1Data_1_1HttpHealthCheck.html#a027a3932f0681df5f198613701a83145).

Parameter             | Description    | Default `livenessProbe` | Default `readinessProbe`
---                   | ---            | ---                     | ---
`initialDelaySeconds` | Number of seconds after the container has started before probes are initiated. | `5` | `5`
`timeoutSeconds`      | Number of seconds after which the probe times out. | `5` | `5`
`periodSeconds`       | How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. | `30` | `30`
`successThreshold`    | Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after it determines a failure. | `1` | `1`
`failureThreshold`    | The number consecutive failures for the pod to be terminated by Kubernetes. | `3` | `3`

Example:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 30
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 3
readinessProbe:
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 30
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 3
```
