# Constellation UI setup

Please refer to [Constellation service deployment](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/platform/page/platform/deployment/constellation/constellation-overview.html) for instructions related to the pegastatic content delivery setup. Once that is complete please proceed with the instructions below for the constellation appstatic service setup.

## ConstellationUI helm chart

The ConstellationUI helm chart is used to deploy an instance of the constellation appstatic service into a Kubernetes environment. The service is capable of serving multiple client environments. We encourage having a single deployment for all your systems. The following readme provides a detailed description of the parameter configurations and their default values as applicable. 

#### Prerequisites
#### AWS Cloud 
1. The ConstellationUI helm charts for AWS provider use an application load balancer to expose the service. Before installing the constellationui helm chart please follow the prerequisites section of the following AWS documentation and make sure your cluster is configured accordingly. 

2. If you are using a custom domain please make sure you have a valid certificate imported or created in ACM.

#### Downloading Docker images for your deployment

Clients with appropriate licenses can request access to several required images from the Pega-managed Docker image repository. With your access key, you can log in to the image repository and download these Docker images to install the constellation appstatic service.

To download the constellation appstatic service image, specify the version and use the following command

```bash
$ sudo docker pull pega-docker.downloads.pega.com/constellation-appstatic-service/docker-image:xxxxxxx

Digest: <encryption verification>
Status: Downloaded pega-docker.downloads.pega.com/constellation-appstatic-service/docker-image:xxxxxxx
```

For details about downloading and then pushing Docker images to your repository for your deployment, see [Pega-provided Docker images](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/platform/page/platform/deployment/client-managed-cloud/pega-docker-images-manage.html).


#### Constellationui runtime configuration

The values.yaml file provides configuration options to define the values for the deployment resources of the constellation appstatic service.

##### Liveness and readiness probes

Constellation uses liveness and readiness to determine application health in your deployments. For an overview of these probes, see [Configure Liveness and Readiness Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). Configure a probe for *liveness* to determine if a Pod has entered a broken state; configure it for *readiness* to determine if the application is available to be exposed. If not explicitly configured, default probes are used during the deployment. Set the following parameters as part of a `livenessProbe` or `readinessProbe` configuration.

Notes:
* `timeoutSeconds` cannot be greater than `periodSeconds` in some GCP environments. For details, see [this API library from Google](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/compute/v1/csharp/latest/classGoogle_1_1Apis_1_1Compute_1_1v1_1_1Data_1_1HttpHealthCheck.html#a027a3932f0681df5f198613701a83145).

Parameter             | Description    | Default `livenessProbe` | Default `readinessProbe`
---                   | ---            | ---                     | ---
`initialDelaySeconds` | Number of seconds after the container has started before probes are initiated. | `5` | `5`
`timeoutSeconds`      | Number of seconds after which the probe times out. | `5` | `5`
`periodSeconds`       | How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. | `30` | `30`
`successThreshold`    | Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after it determines a failure. | `1` | `1`
`failureThreshold`    | The number consecutive failures for the pod to be terminated by Kubernetes. | `3` | `3`

Example:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 30
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 3
readinessProbe:
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 30
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 3
```

#### Constellationui helm charts installation steps

1. Create a namespace into which you want to deploy the constellation appstatic service
    > kubectl create namespace <<namespace_name_here>>

2. Install the constellation helm charts using the following command 
    > helm install path-to-pega-helm-charts/charts/backingservices/charts/constellation --values path-to-pega-helm-charts/backingservices/charts/constellation/values.yaml -n <<namespace>> --generate-name

3. Once the charts are deployed an application load balancer should be created automatically. You can then configure the records of your custom domain to route to the loadbalancer accordingly. For AWS a simple Route53 record in the correct hosted zone of your custom domain should do it.
