      # b) CA certificates used for SRS and ES are different but, both the CA Certificates were signed against the truststore of ES and truststore of SRS

      # To specify a different keystore & truststore using a secret, uncomment the below 'srs.srsStorage.mtls.certsSecret' parameter and provide the secret name containing your certificates and their respective passwords.
