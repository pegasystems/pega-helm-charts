description: Helm Chart to provision the latest Search and Reporting Service (SRS) for your Pega Infinity deployment.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
# FIXME: type not supported in apiVersion v1
# type: application

# The chart version: Pega provides this as a useful way to track changes you make to this chart.
# As a best practice, you should increment the version number each time you make changes to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: "3.23.0"
