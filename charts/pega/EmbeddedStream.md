### Embedded Stream with latest helm chart version
Starting from Infinity 24.2, support for embedded Stream is removed. As a best practice, update your Stream configuration to an external Kafka service.
To configure embedded Stream in Pega Platform â€™24.1 and earlier using the Pega Helm chart version 3.25, perform the following steps.

#### Configure values.yaml
1. Add Stream tier details in the values.yaml file under Pega tiers section.
    #### Example for values.yaml and values-large.yaml 
    ```
    - name: "stream"
   # Create a stream tier for queue processing.  This tier deploys
   # as a stateful set to ensure durability of queued data. It may
   # be optionally exposed to the load balancer.
   # Note: Stream tier is deprecated. As a best practice, enable externalized Kafka service configuration under External Services.
   # When externalized Kafka service is enabled, remove the entire stream tier.
   nodeType: "Stream"

   # Pega requestor specific properties
   requestor:
   # Inactivity time after which requestor is passivated
   passivationTimeSec: 900

   service:
   port: 7003
   targetPort: 7003

   # If a nodeSelector is required for this or any tier, it may be specified here:
   # nodeSelector:
   #  disktype: ssd

   ingress:
   enabled: true
   # Enter the domain name to access web nodes via a load balancer.
   #  e.g. web.mypega.example.com
   domain: "YOUR_STREAM_NODE_DOMAIN"
   tls:
   # Enable TLS encryption
   enabled: true
   # secretName:
   # useManagedCertificate: false
   # ssl_annotation:

   livenessProbe:
   port: 8081

   # To configure an alternative user for your custom image, set value for runAsUser
   # To configure an alternative group for volume mounts, set value for fsGroup
   # See, https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-helm-charts/blob/master/charts/pega/README.md#security-context
   # securityContext:
   #   runAsUser: 9001
   #   fsGroup: 0

   # To specify security settings for a Container, include the securityContext field in the Container manifest
   # Security settings that you specify for a Container apply only to the pega container,
   # and they override settings made at the Pod level when there is overlap. Container settings
   # do not affect the Pod's Volumes.
   # See, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-container
   # containerSecurityContext:
   #   capabilities:
   #     add: ["SYS_TIME"]

   replicas: 2

   volumeClaimTemplate:
   resources:
   requests:
   storage: 5Gi

   # Set enabled to true to include a Pod Disruption Budget for this tier.
   # To enable this budget, specifiy either a pdb.minAvailable or pdb.maxUnavailable
   # value and comment out the other parameter.
   pdb:
   enabled: false
   minAvailable: 1
   # maxUnavailable: "50%"

   resources:
   requests:
   memory: "12Gi"
   cpu: 3
   limits:
   memory: "12Gi"
   cpu: 4
    ```
    
    #### Example for values-minimal.yaml
   For values-minimal.yaml, add the Stream nodeType to the minikube tier.
    ```
   # Specify the Pega tiers to deploy
    # For a minimal deployment, use a single tier to reduce resource consumption.
    # Note: Stream tier is deprecated. As a best practice, enable externalized Kafka service configuration under External Services.
    # configuration under External Services
    tier:
   - name: "minikube"
   nodeType: "Stream,BackgroundProcessing,WebUser,Search"

         service:
           httpEnabled: true
           port: 80
           targetPort: 8080
           # Without a load balancer, use a direct NodePort instead.
           serviceType: "NodePort"
           # To configure TLS between the ingress/load balancer and the backend, set the following:
           tls:
             enabled: false
             # To avoid entering the certificate values in plain text, configure the keystore, keystorepassword, cacertificate parameter
             # values in the External Secrets Manager, and enter the external secret name below
             # make sure the keys in the secret should be TOMCAT_KEYSTORE_CONTENT, TOMCAT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD and ca.crt respectively
             external_secret_name: ""
             keystore:
             keystorepassword:
             port: 443
             targetPort: 8443
             # set the value of CA certificate here in case of baremetal/openshift deployments - CA certificate should be in base64 format
             # pass the certificateChainFile file if you are using certificateFile and certificateKeyFile
             cacertificate:
             # provide the SSL certificate and private key as a PEM format
             certificateFile:
             certificateKeyFile:
             # if you will deploy traefik addon chart and enable traefik, set enabled=true; otherwise leave the default setting.
             traefik:
               enabled: false
               # the SAN of the certificate present inside the container
               serverName: ""
               # set insecureSkipVerify=true, if the certificate verification has to be skipped
               insecureSkipVerify: false
      ```


2. Disable external Kafka service settings in the values.yaml file.
    ```
   # Stream (externalized Kafka service) settings.
    stream:
    # Beginning with Pega Platform '23, enabled by default; when disabled, your deployment does not use a"Kafka stream service" configuration.
    enabled: false
    # Provide externalized Kafka service broker urls.
    bootstrapServer: ""
    # Provide Security Protocol used to communicate with kafka brokers. Supported values are: PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL.
    securityProtocol: PLAINTEXT
    # If required, provide trustStore certificate file name
    # When using a trustStore certificate, you must also include a Kubernetes secret name, that contains the trustStore certificate,
    # in the global.certificatesSecrets parameter.
    # Pega deployments only support trustStores using the Java Key Store (.jks) format.
    trustStore: ""
    # If required provide trustStorePassword value in plain text.
    trustStorePassword: ""
    # If required, provide keyStore certificate file name
    # When using a keyStore certificate, you must also include a Kubernetes secret name, that contains the keyStore certificate,
    # in the global.certificatesSecrets parameter.
    # Pega deployments only support keyStores using the Java Key Store (.jks) format.
    keyStore: ""
    # If required, provide keyStore value in plain text.
    keyStorePassword: ""
    # If required, provide jaasConfig value in plain text.
    jaasConfig: ""
    # If required, provide a SASL mechanism**. Supported values are: PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512.
    saslMechanism: PLAIN
    # By default, topics originating from Pega Platform have the pega- prefix,
    # so that it is easy to distinguish them from topics created by other applications.
    # Pega supports customizing the name pattern for your Externalized Kafka configuration for each deployment.
    streamNamePattern: "pega-{stream.name}"
    # Your replicationFactor value cannot be more than the number of Kafka brokers. Pega recommended value is 3.
    replicationFactor: "3"
    # To avoid exposing trustStorePassword, keyStorePassword, and jaasConfig parameters, leave the values empty and
    # configure them using an External Secrets Manager, making sure you configure the keys in the secret in the order:
    # STREAM_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD, STREAM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD and STREAM_JAAS_CONFIG.
    # Enter the external secret name below.
    external_secret_name: ""
   ```
