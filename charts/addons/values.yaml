# Traefik load balancer parameters
# Pega deployments support the use of Traefik as the default load balancer; however, by default,
# Pega Platform deployments assume clients will use the load balancing tools featured in the
# Kubernetes environment of the deployment. For more information, see the readme:
# https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-helm-charts/blob/master/charts/addons/README.md
# Set traefik.enabled: true to deploy Traefik using the parameters specified below.
traefik:
  enabled: false
  # When you set this to true, you can then set additional Traefik parameters to be passed into Traefik's Helm chart.
  # See https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart/blob/master/traefik/values.yaml
  # To use Traefik as a load balancer in PKS, AKS, GKE, or k8s, set traefik.serviceType: "LoadBalancer".

# When deploying on Azure AKS, set ingress-azure.enabled to true to install an Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC).
# The AGIC is a pod within your AKS cluster that monitors the Kubernetes Ingress resources, and creates and applies the

  # Authentication using which ingress controller authenticates with Azure Resource Manager.
  armAuth:
    # To authenticate with the AGIC in your AKS cluster, generate a kubernetes secret from an Active Directory Service Principal
    # that is based on your AKS subscription ID. You must encode the Service Principal with base64 and add the result
    # to the `secretJSON` field. for details, see (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-install-existing#using-a-service-principal).
    #
    # In Linux, use the command:
    # $ az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth | base64 -w0
    # copy the output and paste it in secretJSON: <SECRET_JSON_CREATED_USING_ABOVE_COMMAND>
    #
    # On a Windows system, use a Gitbash shell or equivalent instead of Powershell to run the command:
    # $ az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth | base64 -w0
    # copy the encoded output and paste it in secretJSON: <SECRET_ENCODED_JSON_CREATED_USING_ABOVE_COMMAND>
    #
    # When you deploy, the actual JSON values that were encoded in the previous step is copied into the "config" file in the C:\Users\XXXXX\.kube folder.
    #
    # As an authentication alternative, you can configure an AAD Pod Identity to manage authentication access with the AGIC in your cluster via
    # the Azure Resource Manager. For details, see (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-install-existing#set-up-aad-pod-identity).
